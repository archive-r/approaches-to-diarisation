1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:01,520
[SPEAKER 1]: Hello?

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,940
[SPEAKER 2]: Hello, can you hear me good?

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,380
[SPEAKER 1]: Yes, hello.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,400
[SPEAKER 2]: Oh, hi.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,340
[SPEAKER 2]: Good day, this is Mike Anderson from HP calling regarding a service event here.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,680
[SPEAKER 2]: And we are in the process of coordinating the V-Para for unit.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,720
[SPEAKER 2]: So our team has already began working to schedule this work order until today at 5 p.m.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,960
[SPEAKER 2]: Are you aware of this?

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,800
[SPEAKER 1]: Yes, yes.

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:37,000
[SPEAKER 1]: They had to find a technician because the original technician had to go home, I guess, for a family emergency.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,260
[SPEAKER 2]: Yes, that's fine by me.

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,940
[SPEAKER 1]: I will be here.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:55,680
[SPEAKER 2]: 1122 Ashbury Drive, Decataw, GA 30030.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,660
[SPEAKER 1]: That is correct.

15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,580
[SPEAKER 1]: And the technician, I'm assuming a new one has been assigned and they're going to pick up the battery at the other location?

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,560
[SPEAKER 2]: Yes.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,860

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:08,680
