 Call is now being recorded.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,260
 Good afternoon, Elkins Builders.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,240
 Yeah, hi.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,920
 I'm calling to speak to someone about building a house on a property I'm looking to purchase.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,540
 Oh, okay, great.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,400
 Let me get your name.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,380
 What's your first name, please?

8
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:15,640
 Kenny.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,560
 And your last name?

10
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,000
 Lindstrom.

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,020
 It's L-I-N-D-S-T-R-O-M.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,140
 Thank you.

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,500
 And may I have your callback number?

14
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,500
 It's 610-4-0-0-0.

15
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:37,080
 That's 610-265-1715?

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,620
 Yes.

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,260
 And where is the property that you're looking for an estimate on?

18
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,300
 It's in Westchester.

19
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,460
 I haven't purchased the land yet.

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,240
 I'd like to see if I could get an estimate or have them take a look at it before I do.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,380
 Okay, no problem.

22
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,220
 And is there a good time to reach you with this number, or is that an any time?

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,160
 That's my cell phone.

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,140
 If they could call me back today, that would be great.

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,060
 Okay, no problem.

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,260
 I'll pass your message along, and somebody should be getting back to you this afternoon.

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,320
 Great.

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,060
 Thank you so much.

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,900
 You're welcome, and thank you for calling Elkins Builders.
