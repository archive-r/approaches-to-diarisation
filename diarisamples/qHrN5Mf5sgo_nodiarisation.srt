1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,600
 Here's what's going to happen.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,640
 I am going to have to fix you.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,920
 Manage you to, on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,920
 Jim, what is that called?

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,680
 Micro-Jimmin?

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,300
 Boom.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:14,700
 Yes.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,740
 Now Jim is going to be the client.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,440
 Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile, or difficult.

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:23,640
 Let's go.

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,440
 All right, fine.

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,020
 Ahem.

13
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:26,700
 Ring.

14
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,360
 Ring.

15
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,720
 Hello?

16
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,640
 Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.

17
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,320
 Wow, that's great, because I need paper.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,460
 Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited time offer only on everything.

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,000
 Wow, this is my lucky day.

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,840
 What is your name, sir?

21
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,140
 I am Bill Butlicker.

22
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,940
 Really, that's your real name?

23
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,740
 How dare you?

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,820
 My family built this country, by the way.

25
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,140
 Be respectful, Dwight, please.

26
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:52,800
 Yes, Michael.

27
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,560
 Could you hold on one second?

28
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,220
 That's my other line.

29
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:54,720
 What?

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,540
 No, but I...

31
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,040
 Hello?

32
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,640
 No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman.

33
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,720
 He's so dumb.

34
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,340
 Probably just going to keep him on the line forever and not buy anything.

35
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,900
 Okay, it's up to you to change his mind.

36
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,840
 Sorry, that was a family emergency.

37
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,180
 Oh no, what's wrong?

38
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:13,780
 You know what?

39
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,480
 That's private.

40
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,500
 Boundaries, Dwight, come on.

41
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,840
 I'm sorry, Mr. Butlicker.

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,080
 As I was saying, we are having a limited...

43
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
 You have to speak up a little bit louder.

44
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:21,560
 I'm hard of hearing.

45
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,340
 He's hard of hearing.

46
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:22,880
 He's an old man.

47
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,320
 Let's go.

48
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,220
 As I was saying, right now we are having...

49
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:25,760
 Yeah, talk louder.

50
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,780
 Okay, our prices have never been lower.

51
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,860
 Son, you have to talk louder.

52
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,900
 Never been lower.

53
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,900
 Louder, son!

54
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,740
 Butlicker, our prices have never been lower!

55
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:33,960
 Stop it.

56
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,700
 That is totally inappropriate.

57
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,940
 You should never yell at the client.

58
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,540
 Now, you listen to me, sir.

59
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,300
 Here we go.

60
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,980
 The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile, and definitely difficult.

61
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,560
 Give me the phone.

62
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,920
 I'm irate right now.

63
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,860
 Give me the phone.

64
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,420
 Mr. Butlicker.

65
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,000
 Give me the phone.

66
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,460
 I have to put you on with my boss.

67
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,300
 Well, I should hope so.

68
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,420
 Who is this?

69
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,680
 Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.

70
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,200
 Well, this is William M.

71
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,540
 Butlicker.

72
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,140
 Hello, Mr. Butlicker.

73
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,100
 How may we help you?

74
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,380
 Michael, I like the sound of your voice.

75
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,200
 You know what I'm going to do?

76
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,920
 I'm going to buy one million dollars' worth of paper products today.

77
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,860
 See, that's done.

78
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,540
 Thank you very much, sir.

79
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,160
 I don't think you'll regret it.

80
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,380
 You're the master.

81
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,580
 There is one condition, Michael.

82
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,020
 Yes?

83
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,460
 You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.

84
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,320
 Don't do it, Michael.

85
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,360
 It's a million-dollar sale.
