1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,120
[SPEAKER 1]: Hello Eloise, speaking.

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,480
[SPEAKER 2]: Hi Eloise, this is Sophia.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,180
[SPEAKER 2]: Good day.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,160
[SPEAKER 2]: I'm phoning from the realestateleadgeneration.com.au.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,480
[SPEAKER 2]: We just want to quickly let you know our custom lead generation packages are now live.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,740
[SPEAKER 2]: We're getting real estate agent leads as we speak.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:34,340
[SPEAKER 2]: I know you're busy Eloise, but I hope your team is already set up with a stable stream of incoming leads, property appraisals, property management, and general inquiries.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:34,940
[SPEAKER 2]: That's fine.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,400
[SPEAKER 2]: We'll leave you to it.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,460
[SPEAKER 2]: But we've been working with real estate agencies for over 10 years and there's always a common theme.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,540
[SPEAKER 2]: Where is your next lead going to come from?

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,960
[SPEAKER 2]: So my call today is just to book a time with one of our real estate lead specialists who are based in both Sydney and Melbourne.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,400
[SPEAKER 2]: They'll quickly introduce the package to you.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,360
[SPEAKER 2]: Just run through a few of the finer details, Eloise.

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,680
[SPEAKER 2]: It'll only take 10 to 20 minutes to give you the background of the package.

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,800
[SPEAKER 2]: They'll let you ask any questions you may have.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,900
[SPEAKER 2]: Are you free next week, Wednesday, during the morning or after lunch?

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,120
[SPEAKER 1]: No, I'm really sorry.

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,660
[SPEAKER 1]: I'll be running around at open.

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,400
[SPEAKER 2]: What about Friday next week?

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,940
[SPEAKER 2]: Or we can do April appointments as well.

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,800
[SPEAKER 1]: I don't actually understand.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,780
[SPEAKER 1]: What is it?

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,740
[SPEAKER 2]: Custom lead generation package.

25
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,300
[SPEAKER 2]: This is your line of business, right?

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,820
[SPEAKER 2]: Real estate?

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,360
[SPEAKER 1]: Yes.

28
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,280
[SPEAKER 2]: So these are just custom lead generations.

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,780
[SPEAKER 2]: To be honest, I don't really have the information for the package.

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,820
[SPEAKER 2]: What I really do is just to connect you to our real estate lead specialist so that they could discuss the package with you.

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,380
[SPEAKER 2]: Any questions that you may have, they'd be able to answer it for you most definitely through the appointment.

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,800
[SPEAKER 2]: It'll just take like 10 to 20 minutes.

33
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,560
[SPEAKER 1]: I'm out at the moment.

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,000
[SPEAKER 1]: Are you able to send me an email and I can have a look at it and then confirm a time?

35
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,540
[SPEAKER 2]: I won't be able to.

36
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,200
[SPEAKER 2]: To be honest, we call out so I don't really have a means to email out.

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,860
[SPEAKER 2]: I could set you up for Friday next week and we still have from 10am to 12.30.

38
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,820
[SPEAKER 1]: No, thanks.

39
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:08,820
[SPEAKER 1]: Sorry.

40
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:15,860
[SPEAKER 2]: What about if I call you back next week and then perhaps we can get an appointment time for you next week?

41
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,120
[SPEAKER 1]: Okay, that sounds good.

42
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,780
[SPEAKER 2]: Alright, I'll call you back Monday?

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,240
[SPEAKER 2]: Alright, thank you.

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,620
[SPEAKER 2]: Thank you so much.

45
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,520
[SPEAKER 2]: Have a good day today.

46
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,340
[SPEAKER 2]: Enjoy your weekend.

47
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,680
[SPEAKER 2]: Thank you.

48
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:24,760
[SPEAKER 1]: Bye.
