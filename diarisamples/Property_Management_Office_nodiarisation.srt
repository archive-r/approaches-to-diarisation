 It's very late.

00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,660
 I just got my newborn baby to sleep, and they're being loud again.

10
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,060
 I brought this to their attention several times, but they never, you know, never stops.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,500
 Okay, I'm very sorry about that.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:28,500
 I'm sorry about that.

00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,580
 Just let me take down your contact information, and I'll contact the landlord right away to get this all straightened out.

 Okay, my name is Jeff Matthews.

00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,340
 Okay, Mr. Matthews, can you spell that for me?

00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,740
 Okay, Mr. Matthews, can I have the best number you can be reached at, and also your apartment number again?
