00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,100

 I'm in Philadelphia.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,240
 Okay, and what type of truck are you looking for to have for the move?

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,700
 Largest one you got.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,160
 All right, no problem, Bob.

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,400
 Where did you say you were relocating to again?

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,140
 Was it Chicago?

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,560
 Correct.

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,700
 All right, and what date are you looking to move?

20
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,800
 September 28th.

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,340
 Okay, perfect, we're available on September 28th.

22
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,340
 We'll take it.

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,100
 Great, the large furniture trucks come with two movers.

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,000
 You must rent the truck for a minimum of two days due to the distance.

25
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:04,400
 Okay.

26
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,600
 All right, I approximated the distance between Philadelphia and Chicago.

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,300
 The price will be $1,065 per day and you must also pay tolls.

28
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,500
 Okay, great.

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,320
 How do I pay for that?

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,320
 Okay, many of our customers put down $6,000 per day.

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,320
 Okay, and how much is the total cost?

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,320
 Okay, $1,000 per day.

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,100
 Okay, how do I pay for that?

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,580
 Okay, many of our customers put down 50% of the estimated price as a deposit.

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,720
 Once arriving at your destination, an exact price will be reached and the difference will be due.

36
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,180
 Most customers write out a check at that point.

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,300
 Perfect.

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,560
 Can I stop by the office this week to drop off the deposit?

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,340
 Absolutely, I'm going to reserve that largest truck that we have for September 28th and 29th.

40
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,080
 Is this correct?

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,200
 Yes.

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,460
 All right, I just want to confirm your name again.

43
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,400
 It's Bob Davis.

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,440
 Yes.

45
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,800
 All right, and what is the address where we will be picking up the furniture?

46
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,480
 It's 800 North Henderson Road in King of Prussia.

47
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,680
 Okay, I have 800 North Henderson Road in King of Prussia.

48
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,300

 Bye-bye.
