00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:11,820
 Hello?

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,200
 Hi, good morning.

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,840
 I'm looking for Charles Clow.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,140
 Yeah, this is Charles.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,240
 Alright, thank you.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,280
 So, anyway, Charles, this is Billy from Medicare Ally.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,080
 And I'm just calling you regarding some recent changes made on most medical plans.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,640
 And this year it brings new health plans and drug coverage options.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:40,580
 And you are eligible to lower down your medication costs and you can get your own dental, vision, and hearing coverage in a $0 premium or at no cost to you.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,360
 So, I just want to know, Mr. Clow, does your Medicare Parts A and B are currently active this year?

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,020
 Yeah.

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,460
 Okay, great.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,820
 So, aside from Medicare, do you also have your own private advantage plan like from Humana or Blue Cross Blue Shield, AARP?

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,940
 Humana, okay.

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,200
 And also, are you getting some co-pays, deductibles, or even a co-insurance from Humana?

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,000
 So, how much are you currently spending, sir, with Humana?

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,020
 I'm on about $3.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,420
 $3 only on the medications.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,140
 They pay for everything else.

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,780
 For the medication.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,040
 That is $3.

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:19,720
 Okay.

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:39,200
 Alright, so now to make sure that you are receiving these upgraded benefits and you can save more money on your medical plan together with Humana, I will have one of our licensed Medicare advisors on the other line to discuss to you some policy breakdown review so that you'll be informed and up to date on your Medicare benefits and coverage.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:55,200
 And also, just to make sure that you are aware of the new changes with supplemental benefits that have taken place, which can provide you those premium benefits, cost saving plans, lower monthly premiums, and also for the reduction on your Medicare Part B deductibles.

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,180
 Okay?

26
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,720
 So, Mr. Low, I'll also be needing your date of birth.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,960
 So, when is your birthday?

28
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,740
 7-13-56.

29
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:06,840
 30?

30
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,900
 Okay, thank you.

31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,740
 7-13-8.

32
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,660
 Okay, 13.

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,420
 9-15-6.

34
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,760
 Alright, thank you so much.

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,140
 So, Mr. Low, I want you to stay on the line and then I will connect you over now to one of our licensed Medicare experts.

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,460
 Okay?

37
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,660
 Alright.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,500
 Alright, thank you.

39
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,460
 Thank you.
