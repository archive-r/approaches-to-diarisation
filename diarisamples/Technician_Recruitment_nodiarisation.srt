00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,200
 Hello.

2
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,340
 Good morning.

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:14,920
 I'm a...

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,180
 Hello.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,340
 Who's calling, please?

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,980
 Hello, good morning.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,100
 My name is Alexis, and I'm calling you right now from Barrister Global Services.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,360
 And the purpose of my call, Mr. David, is to tell you that we are looking for quality field technicians in Colorado Springs.

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,940
 So I just wanted to ask if you have a moment to answer a few questions.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,760
 Sure.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,120
 Okay.

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:48,520
 Well, just to let you know a little bit about Barrister Global Services, Mr. David, what we are is a multi-vendor company that provides help desk, networking, staffing, and technician services.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,960
 So we have clients such as HP.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:00,960
 What they do is they open cases for their customers, and then they send those cases to us, Barrister, so we can supply them a quality technician to do the job.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,240
 And I read here that you are a field technician.

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:03,960
 Is that correct?

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,560
 Yes.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,480
 Okay, perfect.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:22,340
 Well, so what we're offering you here, Mr. David, is an opportunity to earn or supplement your income with service work that you can accept or decline on a work order by work order basis, meaning you can work on them based on your own schedule and at your own pace.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,460
 Are you interested?

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,100
 I'm not sure what kind of work.

22
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,760
 I mean, I understand the work.

23
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,100
 I get a lot of work already.

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,260
 I just don't know if it's, you know, what you guys pay, all that kind of stuff.

25
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,240
 Oh, okay.

26
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:39,940
 Because I'm not going to work for a lot of money, you know.

27
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,540
 Oh, okay.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,160
 Well, let me tell you when on, you know, on how it's going to work.

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,700
 So, here, Mr. David, once you sign up as one of our technicians, you will be provided with a technician portal.

30
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,360
 It's an application that you can install on your phone.

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,020
 It's installable both on Android and iOS.

32
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,420
 And on that application, we will be providing you all the available customers and cases on your area.

33
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,640
 So in this case, you can pick and choose which customers and cases you would like to work for.

34
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,920
 And also, it is not mandatory for you to accept all these cases.

35
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,820
 You can work on them based on your own schedule.

36
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:20,760
 And so, your payment is very easy because once you close out the service order or the work order, the payment will reflect right away.

37
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,500
 And also, our minimum pay that we have right now is $50.

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,980
 That's per hour.

39
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,180
 So it really depends on which service that you provide.

40
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,920
 So it can go higher than that, depending on your skill set.

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,560
 I see.

42
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,460
 Okay.

43
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,640
 So are you interested?

44
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,560
 Possibly.

45
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,840
 Do I have to pay anything to join up with this program or what?

46
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,120
 You do not have to pay for anything, Mr. David.

47
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,620
 Well, if you're interested, I just need to ask you a few questions.

48
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,480
 Just wanted to know if you have at least one year of experience in the field.

49
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,000
 Yes, I have many years of experience.

50
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,780
 Oh, okay.

51
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,340
 That's perfect.

52
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,860
 And are you a citizen of the U.S.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,900
 or by law be permitted to work?

54
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,100
 Yes.

55
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,400
 Okay, perfect.

56
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,760
 And are you able to provide a current government secured ID or a driver's license?

57
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,460
 Yes.

58
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,740
 Okay, perfect.

59
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,540
 So do you have time right now, Mr. David, to set up your profile so I can walk you through the following steps?

60
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,500
 Or would you like me to send it to you through email?

61
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,800
 Send me something through email so I can look at it because I got to go.

62
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,600
 I'm heading out to go to work and stuff.

63
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,800
 That's okay.

64
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,780
 So, Mr. David, I have your email address here.

65
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,740
 Just verify if it's the correct one.

66
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,180
 I have home underscore user at Comcast.net.

67
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,920
 Is that correct?

68
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,660
 No, that's an old one.

69
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:42,920
 No.

70
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:50,320
 My new email, I've had years, is the.omnizoa at gmail.

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,680
 T-H-E dot O-M-N-I-Z-O-A at gmail.com.

72
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,040
 Okay, got that, Mr. David.

73
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,140
 I'll be sending an email under my name, which is Alexis Stewart.

74
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,320
 And yeah, is it okay with you if I give you a call back maybe after working hours just to check if you were able to receive my email?

75
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:11,980
 Sure.

76
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:12,840
 Okay.

77
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,380
 All right.

78
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,460
 Thank you so much, Mr. David.

79
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,520
 This is Alexis again.

80
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,560
 Have a great day on your work and keep safe, okay?

81
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,140
 You too.

82
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:19,520
 Bye.

83
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,300
 Okay, bye.
