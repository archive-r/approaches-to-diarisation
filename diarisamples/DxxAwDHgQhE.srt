00:00:52,340 --> 00:01:10,400
[SPEAKER 2]: T H I O Is that an O, sir?

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:10,520
[SPEAKER 1]: Yes.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,160
[SPEAKER 1]: O R One more R.

22
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,500
[SPEAKER 2]: Y That is not a letter, sir.

23
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,280
[SPEAKER 1]: It's the letter Y.

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,000
[SPEAKER 2]: Can I just call you Greg, sir?

25
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,460

[SPEAKER 2]: Bien sÃ»r, monsieur.

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,640
[SPEAKER 2]: How can I help you today, Mr. Greg?

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,360
[SPEAKER 1]: I tried to start my iRabbit.

30
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,340
[SPEAKER 1]: It doesn't work.

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,840
[SPEAKER 1]: I'm very tired and hungry.

32
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,240
[SPEAKER 2]: Sir, if you're hungry, I can call you back after lunch.

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,600
[SPEAKER 1]: No, wait.

34
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,200
[SPEAKER 1]: I shake the rabbit.

35
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,380
[SPEAKER 1]: It doesn't function.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,560
[SPEAKER 2]: Sir, please do not shake your iRabbit.

37
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,180
[SPEAKER 2]: Press the tail to start.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,580
[SPEAKER 1]: I tried.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,600
[SPEAKER 1]: I tried.

40
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,640
[SPEAKER 1]: It never works.

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,840
[SPEAKER 1]: I hate the rabbit.

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,980
[SPEAKER 2]: Sir, your one-year limited guarantee doesn't cover chewing or biting the device.

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,880
[SPEAKER 1]: No, I hate the rabbit.

44
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,100
[SPEAKER 2]: Kitting can cause fire in your house, sir.

45
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,420
[SPEAKER 1]: No, I hate the rabbit.

46
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,600
[SPEAKER 2]: I understand that you are a non-vegetarian, Mr. Greg.

47
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,220
[SPEAKER 2]: But I would personally advise you to not eat the equipment, sir.

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,400
[SPEAKER 1]: Can I talk to your chef, please?

49
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,820
[SPEAKER 2]: I'm calling from iRabbit International Help Desk.

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,440
[SPEAKER 2]: It's not a restaurant, sir.

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,280
[SPEAKER 1]: No restaurant.

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
[SPEAKER 1]: I would like to talk to your chief.

53
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,640
[SPEAKER 2]: We are based in a developed country here.

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,860
[SPEAKER 2]: We don't have any chiefs or tribes now.

55
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,440
[SPEAKER 1]: But I paid a lot of money.

56
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,440
[SPEAKER 1]: It is not cheap.

57
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,500
[SPEAKER 2]: Exactly, sir.

58
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,000
[SPEAKER 2]: It's a rabbit, not a sheep.

59
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,100
[SPEAKER 1]: I mean it is not cheap.

60
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,120
[SPEAKER 2]: It's a rabbit, not a sheep.

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,720
[SPEAKER 1]: It's not cheap.

62
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,600
[SPEAKER 2]: It does have an electronic chip inside.

63
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,120
[SPEAKER 1]: Please, focus on my problem.

64
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,400
[SPEAKER 2]: I don't quite understand you, sir.

65
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:54,640
[SPEAKER 1]: Please focus.

66
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,740
[SPEAKER 2]: I beg your pardon?

67
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,520
[SPEAKER 1]: Please focus on the rabbit.

68
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,680
[SPEAKER 2]: I'm sorry, sir.

69
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,660
[SPEAKER 2]: I can't accept that kind of language.

70
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,260
[SPEAKER 2]: Thank you for purchasing the iRabbit, your personal digital animal.

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:25,920
[SPEAKER 1]: Hello.

72
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,560
[SPEAKER 0]: Welcome, Greg.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,200
[SPEAKER 1]: The name is Thierry.

74
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,980
[SPEAKER 0]: Nice to meet you, Thierry.

75
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,200
[SPEAKER 0]: What can I do for you, Thierry?
