1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,040
 Hi, it's Pat.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,640
 Can I help you?

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,620
 Well, not really.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,320
 OK.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,680
 Is this Brandy?

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,060
 Did Stephanie just say there's somebody on the line that needs help?

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,160
 No, is this Brandy?

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:17,820
 Yeah.

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,720
 Yeah, hi, it's Pat.

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,420
 They asked me to talk with you on this.

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,180
 Apparently you're not going to get your order from Wilson Art, does that make sense?

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,240
 When you expected it?

13
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:34,140
 Well, yeah, I think I paid $350 to get in here and now I'm stuck with that in the kitchen for another week.

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:34,760
 Right.

15
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,280
 There's not a whole bunch I can do.

16
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,460
 I can certainly refund you the shipping charges, but it looks like it's not going to be delivered until Tuesday.

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,800
 And everything at our end is just one of those things that happen.

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,720
 Our invoice, everything says it was shipped three days, but apparently Wilson Art, somewhere out in the warehouse, they just shipped it ground.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,840
 You know what?

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,580
 I don't need you to get on the line and give me another excuse.

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,440
 I mean, I've already heard it all.

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,940
 I'm just telling you reality, ma'am.

23
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,060
 Oh, I know what reality is.

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,280
 What you're saying is, sorry, we're not accountable for what we sell.

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,800
 We'll take your $350, but when it messes up, reality is, it's nobody's fault.

26
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,580
 No, it's the shipping department's fault.

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,700
 I mean, we don't physically go out there and package each one ourselves.

28
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,100
 We have departments.

29
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,660
 Wait a second.

30
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,080
 You know what?

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,680
 And life happens.

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,860
 I mean, it does happen.

33
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,120
 You bet it happens.

34
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,220
 But you know what?

35
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,700
 You need to take accountability.

36
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,420
 Did you advertise the product?

37
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,320
 And did you collect the $350 to have it shipped?

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,520
 Yes, you did.

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,620
 You can refuse the order, ma'am.

40
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,100
 If you'd like to, just refuse it.

41
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,840
 That's about the only thing I can offer.

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,220
 I mean, I definitely will not charge you for the freight on the order.

43
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,620
 I would hope not.

44
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,540
 Well, yeah, I just offered that.

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,820
 So it's not a hope thing.

46
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,400
 It's a fact.

47
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,020
 And if that's, you know, that's the best I can offer on that.

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,280
 You always have the option of refusing it.

49
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,540
 I do apologize.

50
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,180
 And, you know, I'm taking responsibility for it.

51
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,320
 I mean, what else can I do?

52
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,880
 Well, you just got done saying that it was somebody else's fault, and that's reality.

53
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,440
 That's exactly what you said.

54
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,600
 It's somebody else's fault, and that's reality.

55
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,180
 Okay, if that's what you want to look at.

56
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,300
 You know what?

57
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:17,940
 If I owned a business and I messed up like this, I would not get on the phone and start placing blame elsewhere.

58
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,620
 Okay.

59
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:19,940
 I wouldn't.

60
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,220
 Okay, what do you want me to do?

61
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,020
 And that's exactly what's wrong with America.

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,740
 That's right.

63
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,560
 You didn't own it.

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,660
 I didn't own what?

65
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,040
 They just hand me these things.

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,360
 It's your mistake.

67
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,660
 Did you sell the product?

68
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,720
 Absolutely.

69
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,220
 Absolutely you did.

70
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,800
 And are we trying to compensate you for it?

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,180
 What?

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,280
 Do you want the product?

73
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,000
 I don't know.

74
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,580
 It depends on what I have to go find this weekend.

75
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,680
 Does that even make it better?

76
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,740
 No, it doesn't.

77
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,780
 I'm sure it doesn't.

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,560
 It's just...

79
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,040
 No, it doesn't.

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,980
 I have three kids and no kitchen.

81
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,840
 You think anything you have to offer me right now is going to make it better?

82
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,580
 Fuck you!

83
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,100
 Fuck you!

84
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,000
 Are you still there?
