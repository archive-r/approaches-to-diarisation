 Call is now being recorded.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,560
 ABC Plumbing and Heating, this is Betty.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,780
 Hi Betty, I'm having a problem with my sewer drain.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,380
 Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that, sir.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,320
 Would you like me to get a hold of the plumber for you?

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,580
 Do you know how much it's going to cost?

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,960
 Unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to quote prices, but I can get a hold of someone who would be able to give you a better idea.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,960
 I'm getting a backup throughout the entire house.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,280
 Are you a client of ABC?

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:33,000
 I did use them before to put in my garbage disposal, but nothing major like this.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,900
 Okay, let me get your name and number and I can patch you right through to the plumber.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,080
 Your name, sir?

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,000
 Mike Barry.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,960
 Would you spell your last name for me, please?

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,180
 That's B-A-R-R-Y.

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,020
 Okay, and your callback number?

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,020
 610-265-1714.

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,300
 Okay, that's 610-265-1714.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,620
 Yes, will he call me right back?

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,560
 Actually, Mr. Barry, I'm going to call him right now and patch you directly through to the plumber.

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,400
 Would you stay on the line for a moment?

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,600
 Oh, sure.

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:07,840
 Awesome.

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,400
 Thank you.

25
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,800
 Okay, hold on.
