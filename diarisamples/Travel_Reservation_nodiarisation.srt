00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,460
 Hi, thank you for calling Hotel California.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,500
 This is Candice.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,340
 How may I help you?

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,520
 Hi Candice, this is Steven.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,560
 I'd like to book for four people please.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,280
 And that would be for August 18th.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,580
 Sure Steven, I'd be happy to help you with that.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,880
 So, which room do you have in mind?

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,880
 Actually, I gotta tell you first that I am super busy.

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,760
 So, I haven't been able to browse through your website.

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,200
 And I don't know, I don't really know the rooms you have right now.

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,140
 But I could give you my requirements and then you suggest the best rooms for me.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,320
 Could we do that?

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,320
 Absolutely.

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:47,860
 What do you need?

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,320
 So, there are four of us, including me.

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,980
 And we need something with a Wi-Fi and maybe a swimming pool.

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,240
 Got it.

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,860
 Will you four be staying in one room or separate rooms?

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,380
 Oh, sorry.

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,740
 I forgot to tell you.

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,200
 That would be separate because you see we're two couples.

23
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:10,840
 So, we need two rooms.

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,560
 I see.

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,840
 So, in that case, I recommend two deluxe kings.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,880
 Each room has a king-size bed which fits two people, a Wi-Fi and access to a swimming pool and free lunch and breakfast.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,800
 All of these for $200 each.

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,580
 And that's gonna be $400 for two rooms.

29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,820
 How does it sound?

30
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,280
 Oh, that is a bit too much.

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,880
 That's a bit expensive.

32
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,440
 Actually, do you maybe have something more affordable than that?

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,200
 It's just not now that I think about it.

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,900
 I remember there's a beach close to your hotel.

35
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,720
 So, we will probably just take a trip there.

36
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,660
 And you can take out the swimming pool.

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,820
 Is that possible?

38
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:00,520
 Sure.

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,280
 Let me see your options here.

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:13,980
 So, if you wanna take out the swimming pool and just have the Wi-Fi, then we certainly have a room for that.

41
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:23,060
 And that is the classic king for $125 each, which is 250 for two rooms as opposed to 400.

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,760
 And you're still gonna get the king-size bed and the Wi-Fi.

43
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:37,160
 But I have to tell you, Steven, aside from having no swimming pool, you will also only get a free breakfast instead of lunch and breakfast.

44
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,740
 Is that okay with you?

45
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,300
 Perfect.

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,220
 Perfect, Candice.

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,140
 That's exactly what we need.

48
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,300
 We'll be having lunch at the beach anyway, so we won't be eating at the hotel.

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,840
 So, two classic kings it is.

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,720
 Do you need my credit card number or what do you need?

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,160
 For security purposes, we don't really take credit card info over the phone.

52
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:07,600
 But what I need from you instead is your email address where I can send you a link where you can securely pay and enter your card information.

53
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,960
 Okay, cool.

54
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,240
 You can send it to steven182 at gmail.com.

55
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,740
 Thank you.

56
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,440
 How do you spell Steven, by the way?

57
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,340
 Is that a Steven with a V or a Steven with a P?

58
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,540
 That's with a P for Pepper.

59
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,160
 Thank you.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,420
 So just to make sure, let me just spell that out for you.

61
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:43,660
 That is S for Sierra, T for Tango, E for Echo, P for Peter, H for Hotel, and for Nancy, underscore 182 at gmail.com.

62
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,500
 Yep, that's correct.

63
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,760
 Okay, perfect.

64
00:03:49,480 --> 00:04:02,280
 So just to recap, you will be booking two classic kings for this August 18th, 2020, and the total amount is $250 for two rooms.

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,900
 Are all of these correct?

66
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,200
 Yep, all correct.

67
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,340
 Thank you, Steven.

68
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,320
 So after this call, you should receive an email from booking at calihotel.com.

69
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,780
 And that email is a secure link where you can click and enter your full name and card info.

70
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:30,540
 I also want to remind you not to click any of the email that is not from booking at calihotel.com because we only take payments through this one email.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,240
 Gotcha.

72
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,360
 So is there anything else that I can help you with today?

73
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,400
 Nope.

74
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
 You've been very helpful, Candice.

75
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,820
 Thank you so much.

76
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,980
 You're most welcome, Steven.

77
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,800
 Thank you for calling Hotel California.

78
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,960
 You have a great day.

79
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,500
 Have a great day, Candice.

80
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,540
 Bye.
