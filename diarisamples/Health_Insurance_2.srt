[SPEAKER 2]: And by the way, ma'am, I'm calling you because there's been some recent changes about Medicare and we wanted to make sure that you are up to date on your policy.

00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,940
[SPEAKER 2]: And I believe, Miss Tony, you already have your Medicare Parts A and B, correct?

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,440
[SPEAKER 1]: Mm-hmm.

12
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,460
[SPEAKER 1]: All right.

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:21,400
[SPEAKER 2]: That's great because of that you might eligible to lower your medication cost and we wanted to make sure also that you get your benefits including dental, vision, hearing, and over-the-counter for $0 monthly premium or no extra cost.

14
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,560
[SPEAKER 2]: So are you receiving your benefits for no extra cost or additional cost at all?

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,780
[SPEAKER 1]: No, no cost.

16
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,300
[SPEAKER 2]: Is it for $0 copay also?

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,480
[SPEAKER 1]: I don't know.

18
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,420
[SPEAKER 1]: Okay.

19
