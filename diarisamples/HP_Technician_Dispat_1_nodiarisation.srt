00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:01,520
 Hello?

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,940
 Hello, can you hear me good?

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,380
 Yes, hello.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,400
 Oh, hi.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,340
 Good day, this is Mike Anderson from HP calling regarding a service event here.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,680
 And we are in the process of coordinating the V-Para for unit.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,720
 So our team has already began working to schedule this work order until today at 5 p.m.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,960
 Are you aware of this?

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,800
 Yes, yes.

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:37,000
 They had to find a technician because the original technician had to go home, I guess, for a family emergency.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,260
 Yes, that's fine by me.

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,940
 I will be here.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:55,680
 1122 Ashbury Drive, Decataw, GA 30030.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,660
 That is correct.

15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,580
 And the technician, I'm assuming a new one has been assigned and they're going to pick up the battery at the other location?

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,560
 Yes.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,860
 Perfect.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,680
 I will be here.

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,800
 Thank you so much for your time, Dennis.

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:24,320

 I've got it.

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,960
 Thank you very much.

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,780

 Bye-bye.
