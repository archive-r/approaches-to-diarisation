00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:24,820
 Hello.

2
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:27,620
 Hello.

3
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:27,820
 Hello.

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,500
 Hi, good afternoon.

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,440
 Emma speaking with Tony Malfoman.

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,100
 Yes.

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,580
 Oh, hi there.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,520
 By the way, my name is Nelly and I'm calling from Medicare Online.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:53,860
 And by the way, ma'am, I'm calling you because there's been some recent changes about Medicare and we wanted to make sure that you are up to date on your policy.

10
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,940
 And I believe, Miss Tony, you already have your Medicare Parts A and B, correct?

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,440
 Mm-hmm.

12
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,460
 All right.

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:21,040
 That's great because of that you might eligible to lower your medication cost and we wanted to make sure also that you get your benefits including dental, vision, hearing, and over-the-counter for $0 monthly premium or no extra cost.

14
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,560
 So are you receiving your benefits for no extra cost or additional cost at all?

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,780
 No, no cost.

16
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,300
 Is it for $0 copay also?

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,480
 I don't know.

18
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,420
 Okay.

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:51,640
 Just to make sure, Tony, that you are receiving all of your upgraded benefits, I've got a licensed Medicare specialist on the other line to go over those amazing benefits and coverage for you, okay?

20
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,340
 So just give us even five minutes of your time, all right?

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,520
 Okay.

22
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:57,660
 Okay.

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,620
 So, but before I'll connect the call, may I ask for the date of birth?

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,260
 6-24-52.

25
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,700
 Okay, 1952.

26
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,340
 All right.

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,000
 So how about your Medicare insurance plan?

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,400
 So is it from Umana, Blue Cross Blue Shield, AARP, TRICARE?

29
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,300
 What plan do you have right now?

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,880
 I think it's AARP.

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,540
 Okay, so you have AARP.

32
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,680
 All right, so I'll connect the call now, Tony.

33
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,800
 Just don't hang up the phone, okay?

34
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,040
 Okay.

35
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,440
 All right, thank you.

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,120
 You have a wonderful day today.

37
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,540
 You too.

38
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,020
 Thank you.

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,620
 Okay.

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:41,440
 Okay.

41
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,700
 Hold on for a second.

42
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,420
 Okay.
